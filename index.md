# Larry Barrett
Hello world

I am a Data Scientist that was raised on the Southside of Chicago, with a passion for social justice and ending human rights abuses in the United States. Eight years ago, I taught myself Python (Programming Language) and helped to develop/maintain a python/SQL library database. I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), through the Education Justice Project (EJP), where I took classes which focused in Mathematics and Computer Science; I have 10 classes remaining in my pursuit of a bachelor's degree. Currently, I have applied to UIC's Data Science program with a concentration in Statistics to complete my degree in the next year and a half. My goal is to use these skills I have obtained to assist in self determination for black and all other alighted communities. I describe myself as a data preparer & cleaner with experience with program evaluation and data analysis. As a Data Scientist intern within Human Rights/Social Justice — I have refined my skills in git/Github, Pandas, Python, Bash (command line), Team Leadership, Organization and Workflow. .

I am currently working on a project called Beneath the Surface, which uses data science to investigate gender-based violence at the hands of the Chicago Police Department (CPD). This project is led by the Invisible Institute. My latest contribution is looking at CPD’s handling of cases of people who went missing to investigate systemic racism and sexism.
